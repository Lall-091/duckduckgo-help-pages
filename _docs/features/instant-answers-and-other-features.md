<h2>Instant Answers</h2>

<p>
    DuckDuckGo uses over 100 sources to provide answers to your
    searches, without the need to click on a result. Just look for the Instant
    Answer above the results:

<p>
    Of course, things like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=2+%25+2&ia=calculator">calculations</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=people+in+space&ia=answer">factual information</a> are covered, but you may be surprised by number of Instant Answers DuckDuckGo actually has — from <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=AA+102">checking the status of a flight</a> to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=password+strong+12&ia=answer">generating a strong password</a> — we've got an Instant Answer for it.
</p>

<h2>!Bang Syntax</h2>

<p>
    You can search other sites directly from DuckDuckGo, just by using our
    available <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bangs">!bangs</a>.
</p>

<p>
    For example, if you wanted to search on Amazon.com for, "shoes" you could
    simply type: <em>!amazon shoes</em>
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/bangs.png" alt="DuckDuckGo homepage with the query “!amazon shoes“ in the search bar." />

<p>
    ...which would automatically take you to Amazon.com and search for shoes...
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/amazon-shoes.png" alt="The result of searching for “!amazon shoes” on DuckDuckGo—an amazon.com search results page for the query “shoes.”" />
<p>
    Many of the !bangs even have short versions. Use 'a' for Amazon or 'w' for
    Wikipedia. For example: !a shoes or !w shoes
</p>

<p>
    There are
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bangs">thousands of sites covered</a> and
    you can even <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/newbang">submit your own!</a>
