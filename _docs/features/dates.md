<p>
    When searching on DuckDuckGo, you have the ability to limit search results to
    a certain timeframe.
</p>

<p>
    For example, searching for "<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=local+duck+rescue" target="_blank">local duck rescue</a>" could include some older or general results, whereas you might be more
    interested in recent articles and news reports.
</p>

<p>
    If you instead want to see results from the past day, week, month, or year, you can
    select that option from the date filter dropdown below the search box. You can even enter a custom date range.
